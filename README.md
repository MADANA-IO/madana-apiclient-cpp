# C++ API client

<h1>Using the madana-api</h1>
       <p>This documentation contains a Quickstart Guide, relating client functionality and information about the available 
       endpoints and used datamodels.   </p>    

 <p> The madana-api and its implementations are still in heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocols, or there may be mistakes in our implementations. We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away! If you find a vulnerability that may affect live deployments -- for example, by exposing a remote execution exploit -- please send your report privately to info@madana.io. Please DO NOT file a public issue. If the issue is a protocol weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or something not yet deployed, just discuss it openly   </p>

  <p> Note: Not all functionality might be acessible without having accquired and api-license token. For more information visit <a href=\"https://www.madana.io\">www.madana.io</a> </p>

- Mac: `brew install cpprestsdk`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install libcpprest-dev`

### Build

```sh
cmake -DCPPREST_ROOT=/usr -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" -DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
make
```

### Build on Windows with Visual Studio (VS2017)

- Right click on folder containing source code
- Select 'Open in visual studio'
- Once visual studio opens, CMake should show up in top menu bar.
- Select CMake > Build All.

*Note: If the CMake menu item doesn't show up in Visual Studio, CMake
for Visual Studio must be installed. In this case, open the 'Visual Studio
Installer' application. Select 'modify' Visual Studio 2017. Make sure
